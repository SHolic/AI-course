        "\n",
        "N-Queens is a CSP problem consists of placing N queens (N > 3) on an N×N chessboard so that no two queens threaten each other. This means that no two queens can be in the same row, column, or diagonal.\n",

        "The solution works as follows:\n",
        "\n",
        "The is_valid function checks whether it's safe to place a queen at a given row and column. It checks for threats from previously placed queens in the same row and both diagonals.  The algorithm works by trying to place one queen in each raw iteratively. The `solve_n_queens` function, in particular, attempts to place queens in a cell. Every recursive call to the `solve_n_queens` function essentially advances to the next row. Because of the iterative column placement and the manner in which queens are stored, two queens can never be in the same column. Hence, there's no need to check for threats from queens in the same column; it's implicitly ensured by the algorithm's design.\n",
